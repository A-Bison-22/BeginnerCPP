Hey guys 
Good evening n shit 
  
  It's 2:31 am 12/07/2025, which is exactly 1 hour since i joined git, because my friend Prisha adviced me to (shoutout Prisha)
BeginnerCPP is a folder (repo or whatever) than contains my code of basic C++ programs
  
  As of right now I am using the Apna College playlist on DSA in C++ to stay ahead of the curve 
when i am in college;  I've heard most guys regret not doing DSA earlier. Better build some 
foundation here i guess.

  Basically, every nth video has an associated c++ file called ClassN.cpp, it contains every problem and homework given 
in that class. Sometimes i create my own problems and write them into the file if they are relevant.

  Then after the class is over i go over to ChatGPT and discuss the topic with it to learn some minor concepts that the playlist
skips, like default parameteres in a function or something idk; after this i ask it to give me 10 relatively harder problems 
which i solve in a folder called ChatGPT Challenges.

  After this i go to walk the dog (Hendrix).
