Hey guys Good evening n shit

It's 2:31 am 12/07/2025, which is exactly 1 hour since i joined git, because my friend Prisha adviced me to (shoutout Prisha) 

BeginnerCPP is a folder (repo or whatever) than contains my code of basic C++ programs
I am re learning C++ at an advanced level. I learnt it way back in 4th grade but i 
forgot most of it because i got interested in python which had a growing following 
back then

As of right now I am using youtube playlists to learn DSA in C++. Better build some
foundation in the break periood before i go to college i guess.

Basically, every nth video has an associated c++ file called ClassN.cpp, it contains 
every problem and homework given in that class. Sometimes i create my own problems
and write them into the file if they are relevant.

Then after the class is over i go over to ChatGPT and discuss the topic with it to learn
some minor concepts that the playlist skips, like default parameteres in a function or
something idk; after this i ask it to give me 10 relatively harder problems which i solve
in a folder called ChatGPT Challenges.

After this i say hello to my dog (hendrix) and go for driving lessons.
